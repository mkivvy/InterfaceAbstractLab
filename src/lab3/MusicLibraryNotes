Deisgn a Practical Music Library System to store information on different musical recordings

Different types of musical recordings have different pertinent information:

Common attributes: recording type (cd/record/tape/mp3), album title (if there is one), 
main genre

Genre:
Pop/Rock - album, song title, 	artist, group members?, composer?

Classical - symphonic: album, name of piece, 	composer, conductor, symphony, 
music classification (baroque,etc)

Classical - sympohnic soloist:  album, name of piece, 	composer, soloist, conductor?, 
symphony?, music classification (baroque,etc)

Classical - non-sympohnic soloist:  album, name of piece, 	composer, soloist,  
accompanist, music classification (baroque,etc)

Jazz - album, song title, 	main artist, group name, group members, composer

Soundtrack - album, song title, 	show name, show composers, singers, production

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commonalities: 
	album/grouping title (if there is one)
	main genre
	recording type
		For the commonalities there would be many songs/pieces

Each album commonalities:
	song title/name of piece

Genre specific: there would be one set of these for each song/piece
	Pop/Rock - artist, group members?, Xcomposer - not important to clientX
	Jazz - soloists, group name, group members, composer
	Soundtrack - singers, show name, show composers, production
	Classical (All) - composer, music classification
		(Symphony) symphony, conductor
			(Symphonic solo) soloists
		(Solos) soloist, accompanist

a separate class for group members? to be used in pop/rock & jazz? maybe later
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commonalities would be a superclass - called what? - abstract or interface?  

1st level child classes would be of 3 types each containing song title & info 
specific to type - these could be concrete - end of the line at this point for
3 types, but maybe not for classical

2nd level child for classical - symphonic, symphonic w/ soloist, solo - these
would be concrete
