/**
 * This project was very time-consuming and brain-tiring.  Mostly, I have felt
 * like I don't know what I am doing so I am sure a lot of improvements can be made.
 * The first would be to have this as a stand-alone assignment, not grouped in with
 * finishing a time-consuming lab plus reading.  I don't feel I am able to do my
 * best because I just can't think any more.  I don't know if I chose a good 
 * topic as my project mostly consists of getters & setters.  I know I could use
 * some validation, too.  But maybe this topic doesn't make as much sense in an
 * abstract/interface hierarchical world without more distinctive behaviors?  I
 * don't know.  I just feel very lost, confused, and worn-out by the end of this
 * so I have no idea if I have a handle on anything it was supposed to teach us.
